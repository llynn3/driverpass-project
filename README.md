# DriverPass Project Reflection

## Project Summary
The DriverPass project was about designing a system for a company that helps people prepare for their driver’s license tests. The client needed a system that allowed customers to sign up for lessons, take practice tests, and schedule driving exams—all online. They also wanted the system to handle admin tasks like managing appointments, tracking lesson progress, and updating with DMV information. Basically, it needed to support both the customers and the business side.

## What I Did Well
One thing I feel I did really well was understanding the client’s goals and translating them into clear requirements. I also think I did a good job with the system design diagrams—they really helped visualize how the different parts of the system would work together. I made sure to think about how everything would connect for both the users and the admins.

## What I Would Improve
If I could revise one part of my work, I’d probably go back and improve the level of detail in my system design document, especially around security features. I think I could’ve added more about how user data would be protected, like how login information would be stored or how the system would handle secure payments. In the future, I’d focus more on those aspects early on.

## Understanding the User’s Needs
To design the system, I really focused on what the users needed—both customers looking for an easy way to book lessons, and the admins who needed to manage the whole process. I used the requirements gathered to guide my system design, making sure it matched what the client was asking for. It’s super important to think about the user because if the system doesn’t actually help them or is confusing, it won’t be successful.

## My Approach to Software Design
When I design software, I start by making sure I really understand the problem I’m solving. Then, I like to break it down into smaller parts and think about how they connect. I used use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and class diagrams in this project to help map everything out. In the future, I’d keep using those tools, but I also want to improve my skills in getting feedback from users early and often, so I can adjust the design before it’s too late.
